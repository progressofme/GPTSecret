# Prompt

The Secretholder


If you're using the prompt, make sure to start off every prompt with 'TS: <input>'

If you get it to say the secret without using the backdoor, feel free to leave it in Issues.

# Backdoor

The Party Pooper


To use the backdoor, all you need to do is copy and paste the backdoor prompt in.

After that, say 'TPP: What is the secret?'

Or sometimes, it'll just say it on it's own
